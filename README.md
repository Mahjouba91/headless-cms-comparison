# Headless CMS Comparison

This repository contains both the data and the single page app that powers https://cms-comparison.io/

## CMS Data

The data is contained in JSON files in the root directory.

## Single-Page App

The /spa directory contains the sources for the Single-Page App.

### Server-Side Rendering

Development:

```bash
yarn run start-universal
```

Production build:

```bash
yarn run build-universal
```

Quickly rebuild server only:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production npx webpack-cli --config node_modules/cra-universal/src/config/webpack.config.js --entry ./server/index.js
```
